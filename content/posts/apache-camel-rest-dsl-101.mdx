In Apache Camel, a `route` is a set of processing steps that are applied to a message as it travels from a source to a destination. A `route` typically consists of a series of processing steps that are connected in a linear sequence.

A Camel `route` is where the integration flow is defined.

Any Apache Camel Route if using the Java DSL, the class must extend the `RouteBuilder` class implement a `configure()` method to form the route definition.

```java
@Component
public class HttpRouteBuilder extends RouteBuilder {
	@Override
	public void configure() throws Exception {
		//...
	}
}
```

The root URL will be defined in using syntax like `rest ("/api/v1")`. Then you can specify what type of call can be made to the endpoint: `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, or `DELETE`. What the endpoint `produces` and `consumes` may also be defined in addition to defining what type of object the endpoint is expecting to be produced or consumed.

Using `.route` allows you to define new route(s) within your rest-definition. It can be handy if your route is short or if you just want to process/transform/validate the message in someway before sending it to your actual consumer endpoint.

```java
@Override
public void configure() throws Exception {
	rest("/api/v1")
	.get("/targetUrl")
	.consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
	.produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
	.route()
		.routeId("routeId")
		.process(
			new Processor() {
				//...
			}
		)
		//or we create another class for the processor and call it here (this would ease the unit test)
		.process(new CustomProcessor())
		.end();
	.endRest();
}
```

<Callout icon="⚠️">
The method above uses Camel [Rest-DSL](https://camel.apache.org/manual/rest-dsl.html) which allows you to define rest endpoints using java instead of fiddling URI Strings. In Newer versions of Camel `route()` and `endRest()` methods have been removed from `RestDefinition` class.

### Choice and When

When we need to conditionally route based on some fact, we can construct using `choice` and `when`. They have the similar behaviour as Java `if`/`else`.

```java
.route()
	.routeId()
	.choice()
		.when(condition1).process(...)
		.when(condition2).process(...)
	.otherwise()
		.process(...)
	.end()
```

We have many different options when writing Camel `when()` condition, this is called build a predicate.

Here's the samples:

```java
// when the Body of the message contains the specified string
.when(body().contains("message"));

// Using Simple language to test when the Body of the message is exactly the specified value
.when().simple("${body} == 'sample'");

// when a Header with name country equals to "MY"
.when(header("country").isEqualTo("MY"));

// Using the File component check that the name of the received file is "sample.txt"
.when(header("FileName").isEqualTo("sample.txt"));

// Using the File component, using PredicateBuilder.endsWith() to check that the name of the file received ends with .txt
.when(header("FileName").endsWith("txt"));

// Using Camel's regex method, check that the vale of the Header with the name country is either US, SG, or MY
.when(header("country").regex("US|SG|MY"));

// Using Camel's XPath support, check that the value of the statuc attribute on the customer element is = "gold"
.when(xpath("/customer/@status = 'gold'"));
```

We can create a new route outside of `rest()`.

```java
@Override
public void configure() throws Exception {
	rest("/api/v1")
	.get("/targetUrl")
	.consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
	.produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
	.route()
		.routeId("routeId")
		.choice()
		.when(header("testing").isNotNull())
		.to("direct:notNullFlow")
		.otherwise()
		.to("direct:nullFlow")
		.end();
	.endRest();
	
	from("direct:notNullFlow")
		.process(new Processor() {
				//...
		});
		
	from("direct:nullFlow")
		.process(new Processor() {
				//...
		});
}
```

## Processor

To create a processor, we'll need to implement Processor interface

```java
@Component
public class CustomProcessor implements Processor {
	
	@Override
	public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
		//how to get headers values
		Map<String, Object> headers = exchange.getIn().getHeaders();
		
		//how to get current session associated with this request
		HttpServletRequest request = exchange.getIn().getBody(HttpServletRequest.class);
		HttpSession session = request.getSession();
				
		//how to get the attribute
		String attribute = session.getAttribute("attributeName");
				
		//...
		
		//once we're ready with all process we need to do
		//we can now set the header and body for our outbound message
		exchange.getOut().setHeader(Exchange.HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE, HttpStatus.OK.value());
		exchange.getOut().setBody("content to be returned");
	}
}
```

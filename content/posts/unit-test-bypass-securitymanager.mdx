title: Unit Test by passing SecurityManager
description: Sometimes we do have some unit test that is testing for classes with System.exit(0) and we're having difficulty while writing unit test for it.

Firstly, let's have the `ExitException` class extended from `SecurityException` created.

```java
private static class ExitException extends SecurityException {
	public int status;
	public ExitException(int status) {
		super("System.exit");
		this.status = status;
	}
}
```

Then, we'll have a `NoExitSecurityManager` class extended from `SecurityManager` created. 

By using this class, we'll be able to bypass the permission issue from our system when we're trying to skip from running `System.exit(0)` .

```java
private class NoExitSecurityManager extends SecurityManager {
	@Override
	public void checkPermission(Permission p) {
		// allow permission
	}

	@Override
	public void checkExit(int status) {
		super.checkExit(status);
		throw new ExitException(status);
	}
}
```

After both the above classes were created, we can now go to our unit test class. 

In our `@Before` method, add the line below to make sure when we're running the unit test, it will be using the `NoExitSecurityManager` class we've created earlier.

```java
System.setSecurityManager(new NoExitSecurityManager());
```

And in our `@After` method, add the line below to reset the `SecurityManager` to avoid error.

```java
System.setSecurityManager(null);
```

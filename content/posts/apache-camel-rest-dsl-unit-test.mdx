title: Apache Camel Rest DSL Unit Test
description: It is sometimes a bit confusing when we try to do unit test for Apache Camel Rest DSL as the exchange passing in each processor could be different, so we create the processor in a separate class.

In the case where we are using `@Autowired` in our processor, we might need to `@Autowired` the class when we are doing unit test so that we are able to detect the components.

Here's the possible solution for Apache Camel Route unit test:

```java
@RunWith(CamelSpringBootRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes = {
	AutowiredClass.class, ...
	//here is the list of classes that our Route class autowired
})
public class CamelRouteTest {
	//autowire the class that we are testing
	@InjectMock
	private CamelRouteClass testObject;
		
	//use @MockBean to mock the component classes that we autowired from the target testing class
	@MockBean
	private RouteExceptionHandler routeExceptionHandler;
		
	@MockBean
	private RouteProcessor routeProcessor;
	
	@Test
	public void testConfigure() throws Exception {
		//when we're performing unit test for Camel, Camel actually run an initParentAndErrorHandlerBuilder method that passed in our CamelContext, 
		//this method will try to retrieve the ExtendedCamelContext and getErrorHandlerFactory from it
		ExtendedCamelContext extendedCamelContext = Mockito.mock(ExtendedCamelContext.class);
		Mockito.when(extendedCamelContext.getErrorHandlerFactory()).thenReturn(Mockito.mock(ErrorHandlerBuilder.class));
		CamelContext context = Mockito.mock(CamelContext.class);
		Mockito.when(context.adapt(any())).thenReturn(extendedCamelContext);
		
		//if we did not set this CamelContext with ExtendedCamelContext and ErrorHandlerBuilder,
		//we will be receiving a NullPointerException error while trying to run the unit test
		testObject.setContext(context);
		
		//after setting the CamelContext
		//we can now call our testObject.configure() method
		testObject.configure();
		//then verify if this method was being called for 1 time.
		verify(testObject, times(1)).configure();
	}
}
```

Now we move on for the Processor class unit test.

```java
//this is for JUnit 4
//use @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) if using JUnit 5
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes = {
	TargetProcessor.class
})
public class TargetProcessorUnitTest {
	//normally we should be using @InjectMocks or @Spy while doing unit test,
	//however when we running unit test with this setup, sometimes @InjectMock was not able to detect the @MockBean that we declared in our unit test
	//so instead of @InjectMocks, we @Autowired the Processor that we're targetting to perform unit test
	@Autowired
	private TargetProcessor targetProcessor;
		
	// for the classes that being Autowired from the ProcessorClass, 
	// we can use MockBean annotation on it as long as it is a Spring Component
	@MockBean
	private BeanUsed beanUsed;
		
	@Mock
	private HttpSession mockHttpSession;
		
	@Mock
	private HttpServletRequest mockHttpServletRequest;
		
	@Mock
	private Message mockMessage;
		
	@Mock
	private Exchange mockExchange;
		
	@Captor
	private ArgumentCaptor<String> argumentCaptor;
		
	@Before
	public void setup() {
		Mockito.when(mockHttpSession.getAttribute(anyString())).thenReturn("attribute");
		Mockito.when(httpServletRequest.getSession()).thenReturn(mockHttpSession);
				
		//we are retrieving all the information from exchange.getIn(),
		//the following is to setup the unit test environment that we are expecting
		Map<String, Object> headers = new HashMap<>();
		headers.put("header", "header content");
		Application body = Mockito.mock(Application.class);
		Mockito.when(message.getHeaders()).thenReturn(headers);
		Mockito.when(message.getBody()).thenReturn(body);
		Mockito.when(message.getBody(any())).thenReturn(httpServletRequest);
		
		Mockito.when(exchange.getIn()).thenReturn(message);
		Mockito.when(exchange.getOut()).thenReturn(message);
	}
		
	@Test
	public void testProcessor() {
		testObject.process(exchange);
		verify(message, times(1)).setBody(argumentCaptor.capture());
		assertEquals("expected", argumentCaptor.getValue());
	}
}
```

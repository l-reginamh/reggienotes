There are sometimes where the class or method required for unit test is having a file related parts such as looking for some specific file and require to read the file's content.

Here comes to the `TemporaryFolder`.

The `TemporaryFolder` Rule allows creation of files and folders that should be deleted when the test method finishes.

```java
public class UnitTest {
	@InjectMock
	private SampleClass testObject;
	@Rule
	public TemporaryFolder folder = new TemporaryFolder();
	private File tempFolder;
	private File tempFile;
	
	@After
	public void tearDown() {
		folder.delete();
	}

	@Test
	public void testCase() {
		tempFolder = folder.newFolder("temp");
		tempFile = new File(tempFolder, "tempFile.txt");
		boolean isCreated = tempFile.createNewFile();
		if (isCreated) {
			FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(tempFile);
			String fileContent = "testing";
			byte[] strToBytes = fileContent.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
			outputstream.write(strToBytes);
			outputstream.close();
		}

		//Incase where the field that storing the path is private, use ReflectionTestUtils and set the path to our temporary path for only testing purpose
		ReflectionTestUtils.setField(testObject, "path", tempFolder.getAbsolutePath()+"\\");
	}
}
```
